# Thoughts

* Where is the API Version displayed for each API?
* Can I have mulitple versions available for each API?
* How can I make this public?
* Why do I get `Error: [mobx] An invariant failed, however the error is obfuscated because this is an production build.` in the schema area and `Try It`?
* Why do endpoints get lumped under `Other`?
* How do I use my own domain?
* What is the cost?
* Can I separate this from my GitHub account?
